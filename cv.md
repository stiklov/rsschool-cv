I'm very exhausted in study and planning to do everything! I have some skills in python and js and I hope it will be helpful.

#### My skills:
* python
* js
* good communication with people 
* dancing :)

#### Code example:
```
let addDigits = function(num) {
    res = num.toString().split('').reduce((a, b) => +a + +b, 0)
    res1 = res.toString().split('').reduce((a, b) => +a + +b, 0);
    return result = (res1.toString().length === 1) ? res1 : res1.toString().split('').reduce((a, b) => +a + +b, 0);
};
```

#### Work experience:
I'm working with 4d animation and have experience in writing scripts for my work by using Python.
Also, I was practiced a lot with js and python algorithmic tasks.

#### Studied:
**Voronezh State University:**
* Bachelor Degree in Computer Science
* Magister Degree in Applied Mathematics, Informatics, and Mechanics

#### English level: 
B1 _(I want to think that)_
